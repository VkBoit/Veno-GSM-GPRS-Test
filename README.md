# Veno-GSM-GPRS-Test


This is a demo for a GSM module (SIM800l) GPRS

Edit the phone number and url of the server.
It has SMS control to demonstrate both SMS control and Uploading values.
Send an SMS with the text "PUMPON 5" to the Sim card number used in your module. 
This 'turns on' the pump for 5 seconds and sends an SMS notification to the number
you entered at the top. Some value is then uploaded to the server to demonstrate
the HTTP... you can modify it to do whatever. Have fun
